# SOCIALBOOK - Your Social Media Playground

**SOCIALBOOK** is a social media website built as a practice project to help improve my Frontend skills(CSS) using React, Vite, and Material-UI. It offers a simple yet functional platform for users to share their thoughts, interact with others, and explore a world of connections. 

This project is designed to help me learn and showcase my proficiency in using Material-UI to create a visually appealing and responsive web application.

## Features
